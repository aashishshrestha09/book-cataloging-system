# 📚 Book Cataloging System — Cross-Language Application Development

## 📖 Project Overview

This is a group project for **MSCS-632: Advanced Programming Languages** at University of the Cumberlands, Summer 2025 First Bi-term.

We have implemented a **Book Cataloging System** in **C#** and **Ruby** to compare how both languages handle similar functionalities, focusing on data storage, querying, and iteration.
